# repo-copy

Utility program which:
1. Retrieves complete repository configuration for one or more repos.
1. Compares and returns differences in configuration between 2 repos.
1. Creates a new repository, copying the configuration and content of a template repository

The application can be run as a REST service or a command line application.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the [repo-copy repo](https://github.com/bidnessforb/repo-copy)
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run the server or the command line application with appropriate parameters (see below)

### Running as a server

To start the server:
1. `cd` to the repo-copy project directory.
1. Run `start-server`
 
`start-server` takes an optional parameter, PORT.  Otherwise the server will listen
on the default port, 3000.

__NOTE:__ `package.json` includes the appropriate entries in the `bin` section that should install
the `start-server` command on your machine after you run `npm install`.  Unfortunately it doesn't work
reliably in my environment, probably due to node configuration wierdness.  So if the native command doesn't work,
just use node:

`node createRepocontroller.js <port>`

See [REST API](#REST-API) for information on making REST calls to the server.

### Running on the command line
Assuming `npm install` worked as advertised, you can run repo-copy on the command line
using the `repo-copy` command.  If not, run the shim using node:

`node cli.js <args>`

#### Arguments ####

|`-k`  |`--tokens`    |array  |      |`mode=create` only. List of key/value pairs, used to substitute values for tokens in template repository content copied into a new repository.  __NOTE:__Not implemented for CI  |
 
Examples

1. Retrieve repository configuration information 

`$ node repo-copy -t https://github.com/myorg/myrepo`                           
  
2. Create a new repository copying the configuration of a template repository   

`$ node repo-copy -t https://github.com/myorg/myrepo -n myNewRepo -o myOtherOrg`           

3. Retrieve a list of configuration differences between 2 repositories          

`$ node repo-copy -t https://github.com/sourceOrg/sourceRepo -n myCompareRepo -o myCompareOrg`                                 

### REST API ###

There are three endpoints in the `repo-copy` REST API:

1. `POST /getRepoConfig`     - Return configuration for one ore more repositories.
2. `POST /repoAudit`         - Return configuration differences between two repositories.
3. `POST /createRepo`        - Create a new repository based on the configuration of a template repository

#### REST: getRepoConfig ####

The `getRepoConfig` endpoint takes an array of one or more URLs
`[`
  `{"URL":"https://github.com/someorg/somerepo"}`
  `{"URL":"https://github.com/anotherorg/anotherrepo"}`
 `]`
 
The response contains a JSON model of the repositories configuration.  This is much more complete than that
 available using either the GitHub v3 or v4 APIs.  Currently the configuration returned contains the following elements
 
 |Element|Desc|
 |----|----|
 |`repo`|General repository information|
 |`tree`|The content tree of the repository (`/refs/head/master`)|
 |`users`|Users assigned access to the repository, and their permissions|
 |`teams`|Teams assigned permissions in the repository|
 |`branches`|Repository branches, with protection configuration|
 |`hooks`|Repository webhooks|
 |`labels`|Repository labels|
 |`topics`|Topics assigned to the repository|
 |`errors`|Non-fatal errors which occurred during configuration retrieval|
 
 #### REST: repoAudit ####
 
 The `repoAudit` endpoint takes an array of two URLs.  The first is the template repository,
 the second is the comparison repository.
 
 `[`
   `{"URL":"https://github.com/someorg/somerepo"}`
   `{"URL":"https://github.com/anotherorg/anotherrepo"}`
  `]`
  
  The response returns an array containing the elements in the JSON configuration which differ,
  as well as a description of the differences.  Differences are generated by [deep-diff](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deep-diff)
  which can detect changes in both data and structure.
  
  ```javascript
  "msg": {
          "diffs": [
              {
                  "type": "Different values",
                  "path": "repo/name/"
              },
              {
                  "type": "Different values",
                  "path": "repo/description/"
              },
              {
                  "type": "Array change",
                  "path": "tree/tree/"
              },
              {
                  "type": "Array change",
                  "path": "tree/tree/"
              },
              {
                  "type": "Array change",
                  "path": "tree/tree/"
              }
```   
#### REST: createRepo ####

The `createRepo` endpoint creates a new repository with the same configuration and content as the specified 
template repository.  If the optional `tokens` argument is supplied, all matching tokens in content in the template repository will
 be replaced by their corresponding values before being copied into the new repository.  The token format to use in template content is `<token>`.
 
```javascript
{
	 "templateRepoURL":"https://github.com/myorg/myrepo"
	,"newRepoOwner":"anotherorg"
	,"newRepoName":"NewRepo"
	,"tokens": [
    ["customer", "My Customer"],
    ["PRP", "Bryan Cross"],
    ["PRPEmail", "bryancross@github.com"],
    ["PRPGitHubID", "@bryancross"],
    ["CustomerLogoURL", "https://www.foo.com/someimage.jpg"]
    ]
}
```
