# repo-template-lite

Stripped down version of [repo-template](https://github.com/bryancross/repo-template-lite).  Logging and other
non-essential bits removed.

Utility server which accepts requests to create new repositories based on 
configuration files stored in a GitHub repo.  The server implements a standard GitHub workflow by creating
a Pull Request in a configured repository with the parameters of the request.  
When that Pull Request is merged, the server traps the event via a webhook and 
automatically creates the new repository according to the configuration.

Repo-template is designed work as part of a specially designated and configured repository which serves
to accept and store repository requests.  Learn more about how to configure this repository [below](https://octodemo.com/rebelware/repo-template/blob/update-readme/README.md#request-repository)

### Getting Started

1. Setup a repository to store your repository configuration pull requests (see  #request-repository below).
2. Clone the `repo-template` repository.
3. Run `./script/bootstrap.sh`
4. Run `./script/tunnel.sh` to create an `ngrok` proxy for your webhooks to call.  Ensure your webhooks call this URL when you setup your Request Repository.
5. Run ./script/repo_template.sh to start the server
    `./script/repo_template.sh start`
6. Make a REST call to the POST `/init` endpoint.  Include a properly scoped PAT in the Authentication header and a valid config in the body.
7. make a REST call to the POST `/requestRepo` endpoint with the appropriate payload:
```javascript
{"newRepoOwner":"OrgOrUser"
,"newRepoName":"aRepoName"
,"newRepoTemplate":"default"
,"newRepoRequester":"someguy"}
```

### Modes of operation
    
Repo-template performs 2 functions:
    
1. Create Pull Requests requesting new repositories.
2. Responding to repo request Pull Requests, creating new repositories when they are merged.
    
In all cases, you can configure repo-template to:
    
 - Create a repository
 - Add teams and individuals as collaborators
 - Create branches
 - Configure branch protection
 - Configure webhooks
    
#### Postman REST API call configurations

If you use [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/), you can import and use
the postman collection stored in `./tests/repo-template-postman_collection.json`.  Just be sure to
replace the place-holders with a properly scoped GitHub PAT.
    
#### Future work

  Some ideas which seem useful include:
  - [ ] Specify an existing repository as a template
  - [ ] Specify a repository and create a configuration file describing it for future use
  - [X] Parse Pull Requests on merge for specific text which would trigger a new repository build.  Parameters to be included in the body of the PR
  - [X] Include webhooks in configuration of new repositories
  - [X] Manage configuration data in a repository rather than the filesystem.
  
#### TODO

  - [ ] Add tests
  - [X] Add provision for passing username and PAT as part of the request to the server
  - [X] Add provision to flush job log to file.
    
### Command line Usage

## Responding to Pull Requests
              
If you want repo-template to automatically create new repositories when request Pull Requests are merged,
you'll need to create a webhook.  

1. Create a webhook in a repository pointing to https://<your_server>:<your_port>/pullrequest endpoint
2. Configure the webhook to respond to Pull Request events and push events.

To create a repository request:

Create a file in the repository configured to serve such requests and include the following JSON:

1. Include configuration parameters as well as the REPOSITORY_REQUEST token in the body of the PR.  Be sure to replace the values with those meaningful in your environment:

```JSON
{
 "newRepoOwner":"someid"
,"newRepoName":"aName"
,"newRepoTemplate":"aTemplate"
,"newRepoRequester":"someguy"
}
```
 
2. Commit the file to a new branch
3. Create a Pull Request against the branch configured for this purpose by the `repoRequestBranch` parameter in 
 `./config/config-example.json`
4. When the PR is merged, the webhook will send the configuration parameters to the /pullrequest endpoint.

Once the repository is created, repo-template will create an issue with a link to the log file for the 
creation process

##  Configuration

#### Request Repository 
 
 Repo-template is intended work as a webhook service against a specially designated and configured _request repository_.  
 Users will commit configuration files referencing pre-defined templates, and then create Pull Requests in this repository with 
 those commits.  Administrators can then review the Pull Requests, make changes to the configuration files, and then merge or 
 deny the Pull Request.  Repo-Template will automatically create repositories according to the configuration files when the 
 pull request is merged.
 
#### Request Repository configuration

1. Create a repository, e.g., repoRequests
2. Protect the master branch, limiting those who can push to the branch to a team tasked with reviewing and approving 
repository creation requests.  
3. Create a webhook pointing to the `pullrequest` endpoint on your instance of the repo-template server.
5. Grant access to whomever in your organization you'd like to be able to make requests for new repositories.

#### Application configuration

There are two application level configurations:
 - Server configuration: Default parameters for the repo-template server

### Server Configuration

Server configuration is stored in `./config/config-example.json`.  This file also serves
as the template for the job logging mechanism.    

NOTE: The user specified must currently be a site admin

```json
